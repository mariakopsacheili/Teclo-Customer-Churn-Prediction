# Telco-Customer-Churn-Prediction

Telco, a leading telecommunications company established in 2000, delivers a wide range of services, including mobile and landline communications, high-speed Internet (broadband, fiber, and wireless), TV and streaming entertainment, and online security solutions.

The company assigned me the task of developing a machine learning-based churn prediction model using historical customer data. The goal is to identify at-risk customers and enable the marketing team to design targeted retention strategies, ultimately reducing attrition and improving customer loyalty.
